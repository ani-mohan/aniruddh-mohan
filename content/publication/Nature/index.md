abstract: Weight, computing load, sensor load and possibly higher drag may increase the energy use of automated electric vehicles relative to human-driven electric vehicles, although this increase may be offset by smoother driving. Here, we use a vehicle dynamics model to evaluate the trade-off between automation and electric vehicle range and battery longevity. We find that automation will likely reduce electric vehicle range by 5–10% for suburban driving and by 10–15% for city driving. The effect on range is strongly influenced by sensor drag for suburban driving and computing loads for city driving. The impact of automation on battery longevity is negligible. While some commentators have suggested that the power and energy requirements of automation mean that the first automated vehicles will be gas–electric hybrids, our results suggest that this need not be the case if automakers can implement energy-efficient computing and aerodynamic sensor stacks.

  caption: 'Results of the MC simulation of AEV range for different EV models. The y axis shows the percentage change in range for the AEV compared to the base EV, (RangeAEV – RangeEV)/RangeEV. The horizontal red line is the median change in range, and the red data points are the data that are beyond the whisker where the maximum whisker length is 1.5 times the interquartile range. The x axis lists the five EVs considered in the analysis. **a**, Box plot showing the range impact for the composite drive profile and for automated solutions with and without LiDAR. **b**, Box plot showing the range impacts for the city drive profile and for automated solutions with and without LiDAR.
