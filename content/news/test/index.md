The [version 2.0](https://aniruddh-mohan.com/) :
* a new structure with a sphinx template
* tutorials are now written in rst format, instead of html, which should facilitate future collaborations
* a gorgeous dark mode (for the tutorials, not yet for the index page)

The [version 1.0](scholar.google.com) is still visible here, but is not maintained and some commands are likely to be obsolete.
