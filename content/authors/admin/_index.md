Welcome to my website. I do have a standard bio but it explains little about who I am, what I do, and *why*. To find out more about those things, see below. If you want the boilerplate summary covering positions, awards, and accomplishments, please click here. 

My research concerns technological change for deep decarbonization. My connection with energy and environmental issues started when I was growing up in India and was confronted by the twin problems of power outages and air pollution. Entering university, I had a wide range of interests and narrowing down courses was not easy! I chose to study engineering to build a solid analytical and quantitative foundation. This has served me well. After spending a few years publishing and advising governments on energy issues, I did an interdisciplinary PhD from Carnegie Mellon in *Engineering & Public Policy*, where I sharpened my modelling skills while learning how engineers can best leverage technical depth towards helping address societal challenges. 

In my day to day, I evaluate the role of new technologies in decarbonization at a *systems-level*, how public policy should shape their deployment, and the implications (cost, equity, pollution) of such change. I draw on a diverse set of modelling tools (optimization, agent-based modelling, lifecycle analysis) for this work, across sectors such as electricity, carbon removal, and transportation. I often collaborate with colleagues outside engineering, in physics, economics, and more. Maintaining rigor and intellectual depth across new frontiers is challenging. I find it worth it, because I believe such interdisciplinary work can produce novel insights, of use to both other researchers and the broader public. I have also been lucky to work with some great co-authors and learn from fantastic mentors. I hope I can pass that forward.
