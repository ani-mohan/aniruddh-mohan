Welcome to my personal website. I do have a standard bio on here but it explains little about who I am, what I do, and why. To find out more about these things, see below. If you want the biolerplate summary covering positions, awards, and accomplishments please click here. 

I have always been interested in understanding the world around me. Entering university, my broad interests were a challenge because I had to narrow down a set of courses. I chose to study engineering because I wanted to build a solid analytical and quantitative foundation to help me unpack problems. This has served me well. During my undergraduate studies I became keen to focus on clean energy and tackling climate change, one of our major societal challenges. After a few years of publishing research and advising governments on energy, I decided to upgrade my analytical toolkit. I did an interdisciplinary PhD from Carnegie Mellon in a unique department called Engineering and Public Policy, where I sharpened my modelling toolkit while learning how engineers can best leverage their technical depth towards helping address societal issues.  

My research interests are at a system-level. I want to understand the role new technologies can play in decarbonization as part of a new energy and mobility system, how public policy might best incentivize the deployment of these technologies, the characteristics (performance, costs) of these technologies that best dovetail with deep decarbonization goals, and the implications (cost, equity, pollution) if we switch from existing energy systems to new ones. In my day to day, I use a diverse set of modelling tools (optimization, agent-based modelling, life cycle analysis) to answer these questions, often drawing from rich datasets, and collaborating with folks across engineering, physics, chemistry, economics, political science, and more.

Maintaining analytical rigor and intellectual depth while moving into new frontiers is not easy. But I find the process worth it because I believe such work can produce novel insights, of use to both colleagues in the field, as well as to the broader public. I have also been lucky, to work with a number of great co-authors and learn from some fantastic mentors. I hope I can pass that forward.
