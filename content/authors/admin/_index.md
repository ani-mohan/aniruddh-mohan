Welcome to my website. I do have a standard bio but it explains little about who I am, what I do, and *why*. To find out more about those things, see below. If you want the boilerplate summary covering positions, awards, and accomplishments, please click [here](https://aniruddh-mohan.com/files/AM_bio.pdf).

My research concerns the energy transition. My connection with energy and environmental issues started early, growing up in India experiencing power outages and air pollution. Entering university, I had a wide range of interests. I chose to study engineering to build an analytical and quantitative foundation that will help me unpack problems. This has served me well. After a few years of energy and climate research, I decided to upgrade my analytical toolkit. I did an interdisciplinary PhD from Carnegie Mellon in *Engineering & Public Policy* where I sharpened my modelling skills while also learning how engineers can best leverage technical depth in informing the policy process.

In my day to day, **I evaluate the role of emerging technologies for decarbonization at a systems-level, how public policy should shape their deployment, and the implications of such transitions. I draw on tools such as optimization and agent-based modelling and work across sectors like electricity, carbon removal, and transportation.** I often collaborate with colleagues outside engineering, for e.g. in physics or in economics. Maintaining rigor and intellectual depth across new frontiers is demanding. I find the process worth it, because I believe such work produces novel insights, of use to both other researchers and the broader public. I have also been lucky to learn from some fantastic mentors. I hope I can pass that forward.
