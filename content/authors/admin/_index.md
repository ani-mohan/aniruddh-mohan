Welcome to my website. I do have a standard bio but it explains little about who I am, what I do, and why. To find out more about those things, see below. If you want the boilerplate summary covering positions, awards, and accomplishments, please click here. 

My research concerns the energy transition. My connection with energy and environmental issues started early, growing up in India experiencing power outages and air pollution. Entering university, I had a wide range of interests. I chose to study engineering to build a solid analytical and quantitative foundation to help me unpack problems. This has served me well. After a few years of energy and climate research, I upgraded my analytical toolkit with an interdisciplinary PhD from Carnegie Mellon in Engineering & Public Policy, where I also learned how engineers can best leverage technical depth in informing the policy process.

In my day to day, I evaluate the role of emerging technologies for decarbonization at a systems-level, how public policy should shape their deployment, and the implications of such transitions. I draw on tools such as optimization and agent-based modelling and work across sectors like electricity, carbon removal, and transportation. I often collaborate with colleagues outside engineering, in physics, economics, and more. Maintaining rigor and intellectual depth across new frontiers is demanding. I find the process worth it, because I believe such work produces novel insights, of use to both other researchers and the broader public. I have also been lucky to learn from some fantastic mentors. I hope I can pass that forward.
