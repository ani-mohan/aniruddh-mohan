Welcome to my personal website. My research concerns the system-level impacts of emerging technologies for deep decarbonization. I am currently a Distinguished Postdoctoral Fellow at Princeton University's Andlinger Center for Energy and the Environment. I completed my PhD in Engineering & Public Policy from Carnegie Mellon University, where I studied the technology policy challenges of electric and automated vehicles. My research has been published in peer reviewed journals such as *Nature Energy, Energy Policy, Climate Policy*, and *Environmental Research Letters* and received media coverage in several news outlets including *The New York Times*, *Bloomberg*, *The Wall Street Journal*, and *Wired*. 

In 2017-2018, I was an Alexander von Humboldt International Climate Protection Fellow at the Wuppertal Institute for Climate, Environment and Energy in Germany.
