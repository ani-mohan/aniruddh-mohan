Hello! I am a PhD student in the Department of Engineering & Public Policy at Carnegie Mellon. My PhD is on the technology policy challenges of autonomous vehicles (self-driving cars). I am interested in technological change, particularly as it relates to low carbon energy futures and my work to date has covered global climate politics, environmental acounting, and the social dimensions of the energy transition. I have published peer reviewed research in journals such as Nature Energy, Energy Policy, Climate Policy, and Energy Research and Social Science. My work has received media coverage in several news outlets including Bloomberg, Wired, and Axios. I have also published commentaries for the Hindustan Times, Brookings Institution, Australian Strategic Policy Institute, Wire, and Scroll among others. I hold an MPhil in Nuclear Energy from the University of Cambridge and a First Class BEng. Hons. in Mechanical Engineering from the University of Manchester. In 2017-18 I was an Alexander von Humboldt International Climate Protection Fellow at the Wuppertal Institute for Climate, Environment and Energy in Germany.
